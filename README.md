# PoC_quarks

## Quarks

[Quarks](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Quarks) is a small ui lib from
vurtun, the guy behind [nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear).
I don't know what is the purpose of Quarks, but it looks like a try to make
something similar to nuklear with nanovg as a backend.

The goal of this PoC is to do the same thing as Quarks did, with rust instead
of C.
